# sober-sprout
SoberSprout is a personal habit recovery IOS app designed to help individuals break harmful habits through daily streak tracking, craving support, reflective journaling, and meaningful progress insights.

This repository contains the backend microservices that power SoberSprout.
The backend is being built using Spring Boot, REST APIs, and a microservices architecture, with plans for cloud deployment on AWS.

🌿 Core Concept
SoberSprout uses a growth-based metaphor to help users visualize progress.
  • As users stay “clean,” complete craving countdowns, and reflect on their journey, their personal garden grows:
  • Every clean day “waters” the garden
  • Completing the 5-minute craving challenge grows a sprout
  • Consistency unlocks new plants
  • Reflection and journaling contribute to environmental health (sunlight, soil, etc.)
  • Lapses may wilt leaves, signaling the need for care rather than shame

This garden acts as a gentle, visual representation of healing and progress, rather than punishment or guilt.

 Future iOS App Features
  • One-tap “I’m having a craving” support
  • A 5-minute coping countdown timer, where reflective activities will be done
  • Habit & streak tracking
  • Push notifications for reflection reminders and coping prompts
  • Profile & habit customization
  • A beautiful, interactive Garden View that grows with the user’s recovery
