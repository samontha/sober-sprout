# sober-sprout
SoberSprout is a personal habit recovery platform designed to help individuals break harmful habits through daily streak tracking, craving support, reflective journaling, and meaningful progress insights.

This repository contains the backend microservices that power SoberSprout.
The backend is being built using Spring Boot, REST APIs, and a microservices architecture, with plans for cloud deployment on AWS.

Although only the backend is being developed at the moment, SoberSprout is ultimately intended to become a full-featured iOS mobile application, where users will:

Press a quick “I’m having a craving” button

Receive structured 5-minute coping support

Track daily streaks and habit goals

Log reflections and moods

See personalized progress insights

Manage multiple habits on their recovery journey

The backend services in this repository will serve as the core API that the iOS app will communicate with.
